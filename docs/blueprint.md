# **App Name**: CLI Portfolio

## Core Features:

- Hero Boot Sequence: Simulate a terminal boot sequence with the user's name and role, followed by a clickable name that serves as a theme toggle.
- Theme Randomizer: Implement a theme randomizer that changes the site's background and text colors to different terminal-style options when the user clicks on the name.
- Terminal-Style Sections: Design distinct sections such as 'About', 'Experience', 'Projects', 'Skills', 'Education', and 'Contact', each styled to resemble terminal output.
- Experience Logs: Display professional experience in a system log format.
- Skills Flags: Present technical skills using a CLI flag style to indicate proficiency levels.
- Project Launcher: Emulate a project execution environment by visualizing project executions.
- Contact Links: Make contact information like email, phone, LinkedIn, and GitHub clickable and easily accessible.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Terminal Green (#4AF626) for a classic terminal look.
- Background color: Deep Charcoal Black (#0c0c0c) to mimic a terminal background.
- Accent color: Soft Cyan (#22d3ee) to highlight interactive elements and commands.
- Font: 'Source Code Pro' (monospace) for a developer-centric, terminal-like appearance. Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Use terminal-style spacing and line height to create a clean, high-contrast, readable interface. Employ clear section separation to avoid clutter.
- Implement a blinking cursor animation to mimic a real terminal environment. Ensure smooth transitions between theme changes to maintain a polished feel.
